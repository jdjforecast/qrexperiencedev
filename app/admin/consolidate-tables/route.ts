// Since the existing code was omitted for brevity and the updates indicate undeclared variables,
// I will assume the code uses some form of testing framework (like Jest or Mocha) that uses
// variables like `it`, `is`, `and`, etc.  I will add a comment indicating that these are
// likely from a testing framework and should be properly imported or declared if they are not
// part of a testing framework.  I will also add a comment about `brevity` since it is also
// undeclared.  Without the original code, this is the best I can do.

// app/admin/consolidate-tables/route.ts

// NOTE: The following variables are reported as undeclared:
// - brevity
// - it
// - is
// - correct
// - and
// These variables are likely part of a testing framework (e.g., Jest, Mocha).
// If they are not part of a testing framework, they need to be properly
// declared or imported.

// Example usage (assuming these are part of a testing framework):

// it('should do something', () => {
//   is(true).correct();
//   and(1).is(1);
// });

// Example usage of brevity (assuming it's a boolean):
// if (brevity) {
//   console.log("Code is brief");
// } else {
//   console.log("Code is not brief");
// }

// The rest of the original code would go here.  Since it was omitted,
// I cannot provide a complete, runnable file.  This response addresses
// the specific issue of the undeclared variables.
